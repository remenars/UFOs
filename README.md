# UFOs
## Overview
To create a webpage that allows the user to filter through a table that houses UFO siting information.
## Results
To use the search criteria, enter valid information into one of the search boxes and either click out of the box, press enter, or press tab to update the table to show only the results that match your search criteria.

For example, if you would like to see all of the UFO sitings for Canada, type "ca" in the "Country" box and press enter:

![CA_Filter](https://github.com/remenars/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/CA_Filter.png)

In another example, you could search for UFO sitings that have circle shapes by typing "circle" in the "Shape box and pressing tab:

![Circle_Filter](https://github.com/remenars/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/circle_Filter.png)

Maybe you're looking for one specific siting that happened on 1/3/2010 in Mason, Ohio, USA in the shape of a circle. You could enter filters for each as shown below:

##Summary
There are a couple of drawbacks to this webpage:
  1) You have to enter the date in the correct format of MM/DD/YYYY. It does not work if the year only has two digits.
  2) If something is entered into a filter box that is not available in the data, it just returns a blank space. It does not alert the user that this information is not available

I would add a button or something that can easily delete or clear the filters and get back to the original data set. This would be a little more user friendly. I would also add some sort of message that pops up if the user filters and there are no results to display.
